# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
Confident in every parts of the for statement and the syntax as well. 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had a very productive struggle. I wanted to challenge myself more to not seek help and find the solution on my own. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Being able to use object literal syntax with forloops. I'm planning on having more study sessions to dive into this deeper.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
-No lingering questions but I'd like to know how to capitalize the first letter of every word in a string. I'm doing the problem solving on my own through Google.
